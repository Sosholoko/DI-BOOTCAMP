            <h1>Experiences in the Working World </h1>
            <ol>
                <br><br><li>- I started working at the age of 16 where i was employed at McDonald's,<br>
                    I simply was an cashier and had to serve people what they ordered. No need to say<br>
                    how basic and boring this job was for me, but still is a first experience.
                </li>
                <br><br><li>- Right after that, I decided to litteraly change my life into changing of country.<br> I moved to
                    Israel, where I finished High School.<br> At my 18th birthday I engaged into the Israel Defence
                    Force. I was in Infantry, more precisely Givati. <br>After a pretty bad incident during a
                    mission, I was dispatched into the Air Force where I was working <br> with the design team of
                    the Army's websites. <br>I finished my service with them.
                </li>
                <br><br><li>- After my service, i was employed by many differents stores. <br>Sometimes minimarket, many
                    clothes stores too like Zara, H&M, Fox, Urbanica etc.. <br>I was there a seller, helped people 
                    finding what they were looking for, helped them making a choice <br>and also sell them as more
                    as possible. <br>Then I also was a waiter for many cafes and restaurants.
                </li>
                <br><br><li>- My last job was a security guard for a bank, <br>had the keep the entry safe, controlling
                    clients and keep the order when it was kinda messy.
                </li>
            </ol>
